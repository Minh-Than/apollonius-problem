# Apollonius' Problem
A short demo on an ancient problem about finding possible circles that are tangent to any 3 given starting circles, written in Java.

Issue:
- [ ] During moving a circle, cursor might transfer to another circle if the cursor gets close enough B's center
- [ ] Very quick cursor movement can skip the circle dragging 
- [ ] In some cases, an Apollonius circle ends up inside the starting circles
